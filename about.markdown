I am a Web Developer specializing in Drupal 7/8 and JavaScript (including React, Angular, and jQuery). I am an active member of the Drupal community (here is a link to my profile: [https://www.drupal.org/u/bribread22](https://www.drupal.org/u/bribread22)) and am passionate about writing contrib projects including modules, distributions, and themes (including working with Sass and CSS). I have two Acquia certifications; I am an Acquia Certified Developer and an Acquia Certified Back End Specialist, both in Drupal 8. I am passionate about open source technologies and enjoy exploring new languages and frameworks to expand my technical skillset.
