Happy December Everyone! This year has gone by so fast. It's Monday morning and I'm on the bus on
my way to my workout and then work. I'm becoming one of those people that likes to wake up early in
the morning to go to the gym. I find it easy to wake up early for the gym when you feel motivated to
do so. In my case, I feel motivated because I want to maintain a healthy weight and also because the
gym I go to is really nice. I workout at Equinox. They have a great selection of classes and
their amenities are plentiful. They have a good selection of classes, which are all included in the
membership.
