Search on this website should now be accesible with mobile devices. Note that
the search is still kind of in beta, so functionality may not be perfect as of
this post date. I am still fine tuning the styling for the search.

Here's what you should be seeing on mobile (obviously, your content will vary):

To activate search, just click the icon. When you click the search icon, you will
see the search form like this:

![Search Form](/assets/img/2019/search--form.png)

To start seeing some results, just start typing. No need to submit the form, just
tap the result you are looking for when you see it.
