good: 'I did more VueJS development utilizing the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js) this week.'
bad: 'I am going to bring my car in to the shop to take a look at the coolant issue I mentioned in my previous weekly review.'
one_thing_learned: 'I learned how to do MongoDB queries in greater detail as well as use the Mongoose library.'
plans_for_coming_week: I have some project work coming up so I will be working on that. In the meantime, when I have some free time, I will continue playing around with the MEVN stack.
