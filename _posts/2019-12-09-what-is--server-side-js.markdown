If you're somewhat familiar JavaScript, you are probably thinking of client-side JavaScript.
If you're thinking there is no such thing as server-side JavaScript, think again. Probably the
most widely known JS framework off the top of my head is Node.js, so in this article, I will be
using it as the example.

## So what is server-side JavaScript?

Server-side JavaScript is JavaScript that runs server-side as opposed to client-side.
One of the most well known server-side JavaScript frameworks is
[Node.js (often called Node)](https://nodejs.org/en/). NodeJS provides a widely used CLI tool called `npm`,
which helps manage dependencies for your Node application.

## Why should I use Node.js?

* **It is used by many front-end JavaScript frameworks and libraries.** One of the main reasons to
  use Node.js is because so many modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks use Node.js. Some of these
  frameworks include ReactJS and Webpack.
* **It makes full-stack development easier.** A front-end developer can more easily work on back-end tasks
  without having to hire additional developers for the back-end since everything runs in JavaScript.


## How do I get started?

To get started with Node.js, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) on Node.js's website.
