I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! I hope you got the chance to eat lots of turkey,
stuffing, pumpkin pie, etc.

About my Thanksgiving: I spent my Thanksgiving at my parent's house with my wife and
got the opportunity to eat all of the above foods. I also had another kind of pie that is
outside the traditional Thanksgiving pie, which has a southern flair to it called
Chocolate Chess Pie. In my opinion,
and probably yours too (assuming you like chocolate like I do), it was delicious. This was the
first time I have ever had this kind of pie. Here's a picture of what it looks like:

I also had empanadas; they were really good too. Here's a picture of what they look like:

I enjoy discovering new foods for the first time. Overall, I had nice Thanksgiving and I hope
you did too.
