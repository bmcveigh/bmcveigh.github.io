There are many good places to eat in Washington, DC. Here are some of my favorite places when
I am hungry and I do not have a lot of time to eat:

### West Wing Cafe

This restaurant has great sandwiches and breakfast. I like going there in the mornings to get my
iced coffee and a bagel. They also have good sandwiches, particularly their seasonal "Tasty Turkey"
sandwich, which I really like.

### Charley's Philly Steaks

As you may guess, I really like their philly cheese steaks. In DC, they have locations in both
L'Enfant Plaza and Union Station. I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't already
done so.

### Shake Shack

This is my favorite burger joint. They have a couple of locations in DC, but I highly recommend
checking out their location by the Wharf pier. It has great scenery.

### Moe's

Welcome to Moe's (this is what they say every time you are about to order)! This restaurant has
good burritos, particularly their Homewrecker sandwich. All of their burritos include chips, so
that's a nice addition.
