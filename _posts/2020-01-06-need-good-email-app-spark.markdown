If you are getting tired of your old email app and feel you need an
upgrade, consider using Spark by Readdle.

I’ve been using Spark for a couple of months now and really enjoy
using it. Here are some reasons why I think you will too:

1. **It allows you to easily bulk delete emails.** I love this feature,
   especially with all the pesky newsletters and spam emails I get. It also
   allows you to delete the emails three at a time in case you want to
   focus a little more closely on the excerpt of the email.
2. **You can easily swipe left and right between emails.** This is a simple,
   but great feature in my opinion. This is something I wish Apple Mail could
   do.
3. **It makes setting up your email account easier.** With Spark, you won’t
   have to worry about knowing the difference between SMTP, IMAP, and POP.
   Spark takes care of all this for you.

There are probably at least a dozen more good reasons to use Spark, but the
above-mentioned reasons stand out to me the most.
