I recently discovered a new song I like the sound of, and that is the
song [The Git Up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Git_Up) by
Blanco Brown. It is a blend between country and rap, which I think
sounds really cool. There is also a duet version with
[Ciara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara) which also sounds good
in my opinion.

I have noticed an increasing amount of songs that
are a mix between these two genres. Itâ€™s definitely a trend I like and
hope to see continue in the future.
