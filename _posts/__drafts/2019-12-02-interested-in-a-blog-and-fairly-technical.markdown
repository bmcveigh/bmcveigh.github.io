Blogging in my opinion is an enjoyable experience; however, there is one thing
that made blogging kind of difficult to sustain up until now, and that is managing a
database. Sometimes you want to create content locally or keeping a database can be tricky
since you're not supposed to create a database using version control. If you are fairly technical
and feel a similar pain as I do, I have a solution for you; my solution is to use
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Instead of manually
managing content and doing database backups, you can store all of your content using Git and
Markdown templates (if you're not familiar, this is what GitHub uses for README.md files).
