**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** basically means when computers can think on their own.
When you think about this, it is terrifying. If machines have the ability to think on
their own, they could control the world one day. I think it all depends on the intent
AI developers have. If they program the AI to help society, AI could be a really good
thing. However, if the developers have malicious intent, this could be a really bad thing.
I'm hoping that AI developers develop for the good.

So how do I know if I'm using AI? Chances are, you have already been using something that
is AI.
