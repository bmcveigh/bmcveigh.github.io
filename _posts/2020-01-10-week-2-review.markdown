good: 'I did a lot of VueJS development this week and became a lot more familiar with it.'
bad: 'Nothing, this week went well.'
one_thing_learned: 'I learned how to build a VueJS application as a Single-Page Application. I learned that each Vue component contains HTML, JavaScript, and scoped CSS (only applies to the Vue component it\â€™s in) all in its own file.'
plans_for_coming_week: I plan on working more on VueJS as well as tinkering around with MongoDB.
