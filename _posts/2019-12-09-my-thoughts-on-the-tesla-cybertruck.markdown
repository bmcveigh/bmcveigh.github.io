Not too long ago, Elon Musk announced Tesla’s new version of a pickup truck
called the Tesla Cybertruck, which personally am not the biggest fan of.
Many people like the design, but it’s not for me. Personally, I think it
looks like a hybrid between a high tech dump truck and a metal house on wheels.
It has sharp edges with no curves (at least from the photos I’ve seen of it).

However, on a more positive note, I like the performance numbers for the
dual-motor version it provides. Tesla claims in will do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds
and has a range of 300 miles. It also has a tow rating of 7,500 pounds.
Personally, I’m not interested in how much a vehicle can tow as much as I am
interested in the acceleration or top speed, but that’s just my personal
preference. I do like the [Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/model3) and the
[Model S](https://www.tesla.com/models); I’m just not the biggest fan of the
new Cybertruck. Maybe because it unmistakably looks too much like a concept car.
I like the performance numbers though.
